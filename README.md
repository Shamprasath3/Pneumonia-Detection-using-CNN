# Pneumonia-Detection-using-CNN
This project challenges learners to build an image classification model capable of detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model should accurately differentiate between healthy lungs and those affected by pneumonia.
🫁 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray using CNN
🔬 An Intelligent X-Ray Diagnostic Tool Built with Deep Learning and Streamlit


📌 About the Project
This project is a deep learning-based web application that detects Pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Designed with an interactive Streamlit dashboard, the app allows users to:

Upload a chest X-ray image.

Automatically classify it as Normal or Pneumonia.

View model confidence, training history, and performance metrics.

🎯 Features
✅ Upload & Analyze X-ray images

📈 View training & validation accuracy

📊 Precision-Recall Curve with AUC score

🧠 Real-time model inference

🖼️ High-quality image support (JPG, PNG)

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: Python, TensorFlow/Keras
